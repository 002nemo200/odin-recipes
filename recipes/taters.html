        <h2>An Evergreen Traditional Dish</h2>
        <p>Transforming potatoes into a hobbit-approved masterpiece! These spuds take a dip in the mushroom-onion hot tub, only to emerge draped in a cheesy robe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Potatoes</li>
      <li>Sliced mushrooms</li>
      <li>Diced onions</li>
      <li>Grated cheese (the cheesier, the better)</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper (for seasoning and shenanigans)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Bake potatoes until they're as tender as a hobbit's heart.</li>
        <li>Sauté mushrooms and onions until they're best friends forever (golden brown).</li>
        <li>Cut the potatoes in half, scoop out the insides, and mix them with the sautéed goodness. Season with salt and pepper; make it rain seasoning!</li>
        <li>Stuff those potato skins like you're preparing them for a cozy hobbit sleepover. Top with a mountain of grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake until the cheese is melted and bubbly, like a goblin in a hot tub.</li>       
      </ol>
