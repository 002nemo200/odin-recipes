        <h2>A Timeless classic potato recipe</h2>
        <p>Scones with a twist as unique as The Shire—made with mashed potatoes, flour, and butter, these scones dance on a griddle for a hobbit-approved texture.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Potatoes (boiled and mashed, because who wants a stubborn potato?)</li>
        <li>Flour (the hobbit's dance floor)</li>
        <li>Butter (because butter makes everything better)</li>
        <li>Salt (to season, not for a slippery slope)</li>
      </ul>
     <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix mashed potatoes, flour, and butter in a bowl. Imagine you're making edible Play-Doh for hobbits.</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface. Use a rolling pin or your imagination—hobbits are flexible!</li>
        <li>Cut the dough into scones. Make them as round as a hobbit's door.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or skillet. Time for the scones to show off their dance moves!</li>
        <li>Cook until both sides are golden brown, like a hobbit basking in the Shire's sunlight.</li>
      </ol>
