        <img src=/>
        <h2>The original hobbit recipe</h2>
        <p>Layers of potatoes, garlic, and herbs cozy up in a dish, taking a creamy bath with a cheesy rubber ducky.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Potatoes (the more, the merrier)</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Minced garlic (keep those vampires away)</li>
      <li>Fresh thyme and rosemary (the hobbit's secret garden)</li>
      <li>Cream</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper (seasoning: the spice of hobbit life)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven, because this dish is about to become hotter than the fires of Mount Doom.</li>
        <li>Layer those potatoes like you're building a cozy hobbit fort. Butter, garlic, herbs, and a sprinkle of magic (salt and pepper) on each layer.</li>
        <li>In a saucepan, make the cream and cheese concoction. Stir until it's as smooth as Legolas' hair.</li>
        <li>Pour that creamy goodness over the potato layers. </li>
        <li>Bake until the top is golden and the potatoes are tender, like a hobbit in a sunbeam.</li>
      </ol>
